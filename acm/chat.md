#### 1、Please introduce yourself

Hi everyone,

I’m very glad to be here for this interview. Thank you for this opportunity.

My name is Liao Nianbo, and I’m 46 years old—yes, not 24!

I graduated from Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi’an in 2002 with a degree in Computer Science and Technology. Since then, I have worked as a software engineer two banks and at Tencent, gradually advancing to an inspector-general position. Most recently, I worked at Zego, a startup specializing in video cloud services.

I consider myself a straightforward person with an open mindset. I collaborate efficiently with team members and have extensive experience in team management.

#### 2、Why do you choose to pursue a master's degree?

I believe that lifelong learning is essential in today’s world, and I have been practicing it for 40 years. However, I feel that my self-directed learning is not always as effective as I would like.

I have a deep passion for science and technology. I am constantly amazed by human creativity and the complexity of various scientific fields. My goal is to become an expert in a specific domain, as I find great fulfillment in technical work.

Pursuing a master's degree will allow me to gain deeper insights into computer science and receive professional guidance in my lifelong learning journey.

#### 3、Why did you choose Shenzhen University?

Shenzhen University is a young and rapidly growing institution, much like a dynamic and ambitious youngster. It has nurtured brilliant talents such as Pony Ma and Tony Zhang. I believe this university is as open and fast-developing as the city of Shenzhen itself.

Additionally, the official website of Shenzhen University provides a much better user experience compared to those of other prestigious universities. I see this attention to detail as a reflection of the university’s dedication to learning and teaching.

For these reasons, I chose Shenzhen University.

#### 4、Can you tell me about your undergraduate university and major courses?

I graduated from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) in Xi’an in 2002 with a degree in Computer Science and Technology.

NPU is renowned for its strength in aerospace, aviation, and maritime engineering—known in Chinese as "三航科技." It is a hub for scientific research, where talented students work diligently to push the boundaries of innovation.

#### 5、What was the most memorable experience during your undergraduate years?

During my undergraduate years, computers and the Internet were still expensive and not widely accessible. Students had to wake up very early to secure a spot in the computer rooms, much like reserving a seat in the library.

I dedicated many weekends to practicing my coding and debugging skills. I would bring some steamed bread with me and spend the entire day in the computer room. Since I spent most of my money on computer access, I often couldn’t afford proper meals. To support myself, I earned money by tutoring children.

The experience of balancing hunger with the fulfillment of learning and improving my skills remains one of the most memorable parts of my university life.

#### 6、What are your strengths and weaknesses?

My strengths include responsibility and integrity. In the past 46 years, I have never cheated on an exam. During my long career managing company purchases worth billions, I have always maintained transparency and never took an extra penny.

As for my weaknesses, I can sometimes be a bit impatient and have high expectations of others. I am actively working on improving these aspects to become a better team player.

#### 7、What was your favorite course during your undergraduate study?

My favorite course was calculus. I find its rigorous logic and self-consistent structure truly fascinating. To deepen my understanding, I collected several versions of calculus textbooks, including *Thomas' Calculus*, *Princeton Calculus*, and *Stewart's Calculus*.

#### 8、What have you learned from your internship/research experience?

I have learned the importance of taking responsibility and being a dependable and trustworthy partner for both colleagues and customers. It is essential to respond to every request and ensure that every issue is properly addressed and resolved.

As a guiding principle, I believe in **"Every request answered, every task completed."**

#### 9、What is your study plan for graduate school?

I plan to focus on a specific domain and develop deep expertise while maintaining strong connections with industry practices. Achieving this will require dedication and hard work. I aspire to become a true expert in my field.

At the same time, I aim to improve my English proficiency, ensuring that I can read and write fluently in academic and professional settings.

#### 10、How do you perform in a team?

I have over ten years of experience as a team leader.

My responsibilities include recruiting team members, setting team goals, monitoring work progress, organizing team-building activities, evaluating achievements and individual performance, and occasionally making difficult decisions such as letting employees go.

Throughout the process, I always see myself as both a coach and a learner. I guide my team members while also learning from them.

Most of my colleagues consider me a reliable and trustworthy partner.

#### 12、How do you handle stress? 

When I find myself in a high-stress situation, physical exercise helps me regain energy and build the resilience needed to overcome challenges.

Additionally, I seek support from my close friends. They are intelligent and wise, and their advice and encouragement always help me navigate difficult situations.

#### 13、How do you handle criticism?

Criticism and self-criticism are important aspects of Huawei’s corporate culture, which I deeply appreciate. Constructive criticism helps us grow and improve.

I believe that accepting criticism with an open mind is a sign of self-confidence and a key to continuous self-improvement.
